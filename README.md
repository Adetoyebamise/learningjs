"we think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is not really like us. It is a           projection of a very slim part of ourselves: that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity."_  -Ellen Ullman, Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents
